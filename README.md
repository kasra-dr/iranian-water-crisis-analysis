# Data-Driven Insight into Iran's Water Crisis


### **1. Project Goal**
This project aims to conduct a data-driven analysis of Iran's water crisis over the past two decades. 
The primary objective is to identify and quantify the key factors correlating with the depletion of water resources, with a special focus on groundwater levels in major catchment areas.

**Key Question:** *What factors (e.g., population growth, agricultural expansion, climate change) show the strongest correlation with the decline of groundwater levels in Iran's main water basins over the last 20 years?*
